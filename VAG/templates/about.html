                        This project is a simple platform for managing both public and private services. 
                        Public services are open for everyone to join and explore, while private services 
                        are created with restricted access and only invited members can join. 
                        The goal of this project is to learn, practice, and build the foundation 
                        for bigger applications in the future.
